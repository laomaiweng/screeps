simulation/tutorial:
* harvester.js: handle the 'spawn full of energy' case
* builder.js: handle the 'spawn out of energy' case
* garbagecollector.js:
** handle persistent objects for which the data should not be forgotten
** handle objects which should be respawned as soon as possible after they die
* *.js:
** 'safe mode' when energy is low / resources are scarce, to maximize survivability
       (e.g. draw only absolutely necessary energy from the spawn if it doesn't have much)
** mechanism to factorize the ubiquitous 'findNearest; if(!isNearTo) moveTo; else doSomething;'
